Before using these scripts, you'll need to set up a Python virtual environment and install the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`. If you don't know how to do that, I'm sure Google will be helpful.

Once you've got the virtual environment set up, you can use `evaluation.ipynb`, `confusion_matrix.ipynb`, and `visualize.ipynb` to analyze the results of your classifier. `evaluation.ipynb` contains more detailed instructions for this.

Additionally, the repo includes `xlsx_to_csv.py` and `validation_test_split.py`, that are used to generate the CSV files used by the aforementioned scripts from the original .xlsx files.
